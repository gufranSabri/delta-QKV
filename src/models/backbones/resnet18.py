    """torchvision ResNet-18.

    Two ways to feed a 32x32 activation image to an ImageNet ResNet:

    - `pretrained=True`  -> UPSCALE THE INPUT to 224x224 and leave the network
      completely untouched. A stock ResNet-18 opens with a 7x7 stride-2 conv and
      a stride-2 maxpool; at 32x32 those would crush the image to 8x8 before the
      first residual block, so the usual fix is to replace conv1 and delete the
      maxpool. But that *throws away the pretrained stem* -- exactly the weights
      you loaded the checkpoint for. Resizing instead means every pretrained
      filter sees inputs at the scale it was trained on, and the model is used
      as-is, which is also what makes "pretrained" an honest label in the
      ablation table.

    - `pretrained=False` -> keep the network at native resolution and adapt the
      stem CIFAR-style (3x3 stride-1 conv, no maxpool). With random weights there
      is nothing to preserve, and upscaling 32x32 to 224x224 would be ~49x the
      compute for no information gain.

    Because we keep views SEPARATE (3 input channels each), the pretrained conv1
    is shape-compatible and needs no surgery. Had we stacked Q/K/V into one
    9-channel image, conv1 would have had to be discarded either way.
